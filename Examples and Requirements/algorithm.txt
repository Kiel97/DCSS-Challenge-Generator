Algorithm of DCSS Challenge Generator by Kiel97:

Load species from species_database.txt
Load backgrounds from backgrounds_database.txt
Load bad combos from badcombo_database.txt
Load challenges from challenge_database.txt
Ask user for amount of generated challenges and store entered value as n
Create empty generated_challenges.txt

For each challenge to challenge No.n:
	Choose one challenge from challenges
	Copy all backgrounds to available backgrounds
	If challenge contains forbidden backgrounds:
		For each forbidden background in challenge:
			Delete forbidden background from available backgrounds
	Copy all species to available species
	If challenge contains forbidden species:
		For each forbidden species in challenge:
			Delete forbidden species from available species
	Choose one species from available species until chosen combo is not in bad combos
	Print to file generated challenge number, chosen combo, name of challenge and tiers 1,2 and 3
