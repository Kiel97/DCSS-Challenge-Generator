Have you ever had a moment when you were looking on forum for new Casual League Challenge but nobody posts new one?
Have you ever been bored with playing different combos and had no side objectives which would make game more exciting?
Or are you looking for new combinations to play you never thought about?

Then this brand new DCSS Challenge Generator is for you! Inspired by The Tavern's various challenges user were competing
(mainly by triorph's Casual League Weeks) I have written Python script which from different species, background and challenge
databases combines new Tavern's style challenges. Here are some advantages of this program:

- Provide database files in script's directory, enter number of challenges to generate and output file name! Ready!
- Generate your challenges ready to share with others. No need to spend time on cleaning up output file.
- Too easy or too hard challenges? Or too few of them? Or maybe you are playing one of DCSS forks? Customise your databases
  with user-editing friendly .txt format! Create your own challenges!
- Hate limit of generating up to 100 challenges or your species and background shortcuts are not 2-char length?
  Or maybe you want to add new feature to program? That's to Python it's very easy to edit and add your own lines code even for 
  programming beginners! Grab your repository clone and use your imagination!
